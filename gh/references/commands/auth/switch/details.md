## Description

Switch the active account for a GitHub host.

This command changes the authentication configuration that will
be used when running commands targeting the specified GitHub host.

If the specified host has two accounts, the active account will be switched
automatically. If there are more than two accounts, disambiguation will be
required either through the `--user` flag or an interactive prompt.

For a list of authenticated accounts you can run `gh auth status`.
