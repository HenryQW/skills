# Details

## Description

Edit a pull request.

Without an argument, the pull request that belongs to the current branch
is selected.

Editing a pull request's projects requires authorization with the `project` scope.
To authorize, run `gh auth refresh -s project`.

Use `--attach` to upload an image or video. Without a body flag the pull
request keeps the body it already has and the attachment is appended to it. If the
body references an attached file, such as `![alt](./login.png)`, that reference
is rewritten to point at the uploaded asset instead.
You can attach up to 50 files per command.

Alt text for an image follows the path after `#`, as in
`--attach './login.png#The login error state'`. Without it the filename is used.
A reference already in the body keeps the alt text written there. Video renders
as a player and has no alt text, so it cannot be given any.

If some attachments upload and others fail, the pull request is still updated with the
ones that succeeded. The command then exits with a non-zero status, but the pull
request's URL is still printed to stdout.

The `--add-assignee` and `--remove-assignee` flags both support
the following special values:
- `@me`: assign or unassign yourself
- `@copilot`: assign or unassign Copilot (not supported on GitHub Enterprise Server)

The `--add-reviewer` and `--remove-reviewer` flags support
the following special value:
- `@copilot`: request or remove review from Copilot (not supported on GitHub Enterprise Server)
