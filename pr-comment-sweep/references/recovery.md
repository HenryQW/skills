# Sweep Recovery

Read only for resume or PR-head mismatch.

## Checkpoint

Only ignored `.context/progress.md` may change under `.context/`. Keep one JSON
line under `## PR comment sweep`; never stage it:

```json
{"workflow":"pr-comment-sweep","pr":"URL","snapshot":"/tmp/file","final_snapshot":null,"head":"SHA","phase":"triage","owned":[],"ledger":{},"checks":[],"commit":null,"pushed":false,"resolved":[]}
```

Use phases `triage`, `editing`, `validated`, `committed`, `pushed`, or `resolved`.
Update after each phase; keep repository-relative owned paths, thread verdicts in
`ledger`, exact validation results, commit SHA, push state, and resolved IDs.

Resume only when workflow and PR match, snapshot exists and names that PR, local
`HEAD` equals `head`, and tracked dirty paths equal `owned`. Skip completed
phases and continue with next one. Stop on missing, malformed, or conflicting
state; never absorb unknown changes. Commands requiring a clean tree remain
blocked until tracked work is committed or otherwise restored by user.

## Adopt PR head

Only exact user words **“Adopt PR head”** authorize this path. Inspect
`gh pr view "$PR" --json headRepository,headRefName`; choose exactly one remote
whose normalized GitHub host/owner/repository matches `headRepository`. Run:

```bash
git fetch "$REMOTE" "$HEAD_REF"
git log --oneline HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
git diff --stat HEAD..FETCH_HEAD
git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD FETCH_HEAD
git merge --ff-only FETCH_HEAD
```

Stop on divergence or ambiguous remote. Never hard-reset. Re-run target
verification and initial fetch after fast-forward.
